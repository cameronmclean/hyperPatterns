  "context": "Biological investigations requiring living organisms - especially mammalian systems - can be expensive in terms of scientific resources needed to establish and maintain them, and they often come with ethical considerations for animal wellbeing. They are essential however in order to understand complex processes in a natural setting, and we often need to visualise and measure entities or processes occurring within living cells, tissues, or small organisms in a non-intrusive manner that gives maximal information for minimal cost. This pattern deals with how to capture quantitative, spatiotemporal information within a living organism for in vitro tissue culture systems and model systems involving small animals that are amenable to manipulation.",
  "problem": "We want to measure and locate a biological entity or process within living cells or a model small animal system. We need to keep the animal or sample alive and make dynamic, realtime, quantifiable, and non-destructive repetitive measurements in situ.",
  "solution": "Tightly couple the biological process or entity of interest with a light emitting system and an appropriate light detector to enable harmless realtime visualisation and detection of entities or processes as photons.",
  "rationale": "Light can travel through cells, tissues, and skin, and provides a non-destructive, humane, rapid, and cost effective approach to visualising biological processes. Light as a signal is readily quantified, and can allow simultaneous measurements of different entities if they are associated with different wavelengths. In order to capture spatial information it is necessary to immobilise the sample relative to the target/light source and the detector. In the case of small animals this may be achieved by anaesthesia or physical restraint, but needs to be balanced so as to not interfere with the biological process or entities of interest nor the light generation system itself, whilst keeping the system in a stationary, nominally viable state. The system used for light generation needs to be sufficiently bright and of a wavelength tuned to enable transmission through the medium. Light transmission through a medium is wavelength dependent, and impeded by quenching which is influenced by depth or thickness of sample and location of signal, colour of sample, or presence or absence of fur or other barriers that can absorb light. Light generation and sample orientation or handling should be organised to maximise transmission while minimising quenching. To collect dynamic measurements it is essential that the light generation and collection cycles are time matched with the phenomenon of interest. Temperature affects metabolic state and chemical reactions and therefore needs to be controlled to ensure the system is representative of the underlying biology and consistent between samples or measurements. For many light detection systems, quantification is relative and not absolute therefore it is necessary to ensure the same equipment and detection settings are used across an experiment. ",
